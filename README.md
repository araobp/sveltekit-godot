This project demonstrates a powerful integration between SvelteKit and Godot, creating a web application that visualizes a tour plan in a 3D environment. The 3D assets and imagery are generated with the help of Gemini.

## 🚀 Motivation

The primary goal of this project is to showcase how to build a rich, interactive web experience by combining the strengths of a modern web framework (SvelteKit) with a powerful 3D game engine (Godot). This allows for the creation of immersive 3D visualizations within a standard web application.

## ✨ Features

*   **3D Tour Visualization:** Explore a tour plan in a 3D environment.
*   **SvelteKit Integration:** Seamlessly embed the Godot application within a SvelteKit web app.
*   **AI-Generated Assets:** All images and 3D model textures are generated using Gemini.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

*   **SvelteKit:** A modern web application framework for building high-performance web apps.
*   **Godot:** A powerful open-source game engine for creating 2D and 3D games and interactive experiences.
*   **Gemini:** Used for generating the images and textures for the 3D models.

## 🏁 Getting Started
